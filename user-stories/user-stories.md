i# User Stories

Below are key user stories derived from our use-case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend.

1. **User Registration & Authentication**  
   As a **new visitor**, I want to register an account (or log in via email/password or OAuth) so that I can securely access guest and host features.

2. **Property Listing Management**  
   As a **host**, I want to create, edit, and delete my property listings (including uploading images and setting availability) so that prospective guests can discover and book my spaces.

3. **Property Search & Booking**  
   As a **guest**, I want to search and filter available listings by location, date range, price, and amenities, then book my chosen property, so that I can plan my stay easily.

4. **Payment Processing & Payouts**  
   As a **guest**, I want to pay for my booking via a secure payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal) and as a **host**, I want to receive automatic payouts once a stay is completed, so that both sides handle money safely and transparently.

5. **Reviews & Notifications**  
   As a **guest**, I want to leave a review and rating after my stay, and as a **host**, I want to receive real-time notifications (email/in-app) for new bookings, cancellations, and reviews, so that I stay informed and can respond quickly.
